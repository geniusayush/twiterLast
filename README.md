A RESTful web application that we can use to query around 1 million dumped tweets in Elasticsearch Using Twitter REST API 
The Application should allow us to search on basis of text in tweets, on basis of user handle, aggregate on basis of timestamp, filter on basis of sensitivity, etc.
Everything is scalable and follows good design principles. 
Errors are gracefully handled.
